## Related Technologies and Strategies 

- **Purpose**: This section focuses on two major strategic technologies that significantly impact cloud security: **Zero Trust (ZT)** and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**. These technologies are reshaping cybersecurity and the broader IT landscape, with applications in both defensive and offensive cloud security measures.
    
- **Learning Objectives**:
    
    - Discuss the benefits of integrating AI into threat and vulnerability management.
    - Explain the role of AI in cloud security.
    - Identify the key components of Zero Trust security models.

### 12.1 Zero Trust (ZT)

**Zero Trust** is a cybersecurity strategy that assumes no implicit trust within or outside the network perimeter. Every user and device must be verified continuously before being granted access to resources.

#### Key Concepts of Zero Trust:

- **Protective Framework**: The organization should not inherently trust any entity and should verify each access attempt based on identity, device, and context.
- **Least Privilege Access**: Users and applications receive only the permissions needed to perform their tasks, minimizing the risk of misuse.
- **Reduced Attack Surface**: By segmenting networks and enforcing granular access controls, ZT limits the opportunities for attackers to move laterally across systems.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Constantly track all access requests and monitor for anomalies to detect breaches early.
- **Micro-Segmentation**: Create isolated security perimeters around individual applications and services to control access more effectively.

#### Zero Trust Pillars:

1. **Users/Identities**: Secure all user access with multi-factor authentication (MFA) and context-based authorization.
2. **Devices/Endpoints**: Ensure device security is factored into access control decisions.
3. **Networks**: Enforce strict network segmentation to limit lateral movement.
4. **Applications/Workloads**: Protect applications and workloads, ensuring they do not become a source of attacks.
5. **Data**: Apply strict data protection and monitoring measures for data at rest, in transit, and in use.

#### Zero Trust Maturity Model:

This model, as outlined by CISA, progresses through four stages:

1. **Traditional**: Static, firewall-based policies.
2. **Initial**: Introduction of centralized identity management and segmented networks.
3. **Advanced**: Implementation of continuous, dynamic security controls.
4. **Optimal**: Full automation of identity management and network segregation with adaptive security controls.

### 12.2 Artificial Intelligence (AI)

AI plays a dual role in cloud security, both as a tool for enhancing security measures and as an emerging threat vector.

#### Key Characteristics of AI Workloads:

- **Training and Inference**: AI models undergo training (which requires large datasets and computing power) and then inference (using the trained model to process new inputs). Both have significant security implications due to the volume and sensitivity of the data involved.
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: AI models like LLMs are increasingly being used to improve natural language processing, data analysis, and other applications, but they also introduce new security risks.
